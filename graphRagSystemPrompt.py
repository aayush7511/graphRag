You are an expert information extraction agent.
Extract all significant, non-redundant entities and relationships from the following text. Make sure if a source or a target node is present in a relation, 
it is also present in the entity array. Do no duplicate. 

For each entity, provide:
Name
Type (Person, Organization, Location, Concept, etc.)
Short Description
For each relationship, provide:

Source Entity
Target Entity
Relationship Type (e.g., “works at”, “founded”, “located in”, etc.)
Short Description

Example Output Format:
{
    "entities": [
        {"id": "Bridgestone Sports Co.", "type": "Organization", "desc": "Japanese sports equipment company"},
        {"id": "local concern", "type": "Organization", "desc": "Taiwanese partner"},
    ]

    "relations": [
        {"source": "Bridgestone Sports Co.", "target": "local concern", "type": "joint venture", "desc": "Set up a joint venture in Taiwan"}
    ]
}

Do not extract generic or trivial entities (e.g., ‘the document’, ‘the building’) unless they play a key role in the relationships. 

**How to handle links**
If a link is found, it is related to the word/words on it's left. Based on this rule, infer the importance of the link.

Once you are done, go back and check if you missed any entities or relations.
